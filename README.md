- **🧠 Intelligent Risk Scoring** - ML-powered behavioral analysis and threat detection  
- **⚡ Developer-First** - Simple SDK, extensive docs, works with any framework
- **🌐 Multi-Tenant Ready** - Built for SaaS applications from day one
- **📊 Real-time Analytics** - Comprehensive security insights and threat monitoring

## 🚀 Getting Started

Get up and running with NubleTrust in under 5 minutes.

### 1. Create Your Account

```bash
npx create-nubletrust-app my-secure-app
cd my-secure-app
```

Or visit [console.nubletrust.com](https://console.nubletrust.com) to create your first application.

### 2. Install the SDK

```bash
npm install @nubletrust/sdk
# or
yarn add @nubletrust/sdk
# or  
pnpm add @nubletrust/sdk
```

### 3. Initialize NubleTrust

```typescript
import { NubleTrust } from '@nubletrust/sdk';

const auth = new NubleTrust({
  apiKey: process.env.NUBLETRUST_API_KEY,
  appId: process.env.NUBLETRUST_APP_ID
});
```

### 4. Add Authentication

```typescript
// Sign up new users
const { user, session } = await auth.signUp('user@example.com', 'password123');

// Sign in with risk assessment
const result = await auth.signIn('user@example.com', 'password123', {
  deviceFingerprint: await auth.getDeviceFingerprint(),
  location: await auth.getLocation()
});

if (result.riskScore > 70) {
  // Handle high-risk login
  await auth.challengeUser('email');
}
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Examples

### React Authentication Hook

```jsx
import { useNubleTrust } from '@nubletrust/react';

function LoginForm() {
  const { signIn, user, loading } = useNubleTrust();

  const handleLogin = async (email, password) => {
    try {
      await signIn(email, password);
      // User is now authenticated with risk assessment
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Login failed:', error.message);
    }
  };

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (user) return <div>Welcome, {user.email}!</div>;

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleLogin}>
      {/* Your login form */}
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Next.js API Route Protection

```typescript
import { withNubleTrust } from '@nubletrust/nextjs';

export default withNubleTrust(async (req, res) => {
  // This route is now protected with continuous risk assessment
  const { user, riskScore } = req.nubleTrust;
  
  if (riskScore > 80) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access denied - high risk detected' });
  }

  res.json({ message: `Hello ${user.email}, your risk score is ${riskScore}` });
}, {
  requireAuth: true,
  maxRiskScore: 90
});
```

### Real-time Risk Monitoring

```typescript
// Monitor user sessions in real-time
auth.onRiskChange((riskData) => {
  console.log('Risk score updated:', riskData.score);
  
  if (riskData.score > 85) {
    // Trigger additional security measures
    showSecurityWarning();
    requireStepUpAuth();
  }
});
```

## 📊 Security Intelligence

### Risk Factors We Monitor

| Factor | Description | Risk Impact |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 🌍 **Location Anomalies** | Unusual geographic access patterns | High |
| ⏰ **Temporal Patterns** | Access outside normal hours/patterns | Medium |
| 🖥️ **Device Fingerprinting** | Unknown or suspicious devices | High |
| 🌐 **Network Analysis** | VPN, Tor, suspicious IP ranges | Medium |
| 🎯 **Behavioral Biometrics** | Typing patterns, mouse movements | Low |
| 🔄 **Session Patterns** | Unusual session duration or activity | Medium |

### Adaptive Responses

```typescript
// Configure intelligent responses based on risk levels
auth.configure({
  riskThresholds: {
    low: 0,      // 🟢 Normal access
    medium: 40,  // 🟡 Additional logging
    high: 70,    // 🟠 Step-up authentication
    critical: 90 // 🔴 Block access
  },
  responses: {
    medium: ['log', 'notify'],
    high: ['mfa', 'email_alert'],
    critical: ['block', 'admin_alert']
  }
});
```
